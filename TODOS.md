- Archive journal entries -- or better verb, but they get excluded from future context
- todos should be individually routable, tool to retrieve specific todo by id, icon to copy url for it,ff
- Integrations. If i paste an asana link into a todo, should be smart
- make sure process_link_previews cached results
- expand chat view
- generate embeddings for all journal entries and todos
- then add search and do an vector comparision between query embedding and content
- daily planner mode -- pulls it all together
- I don't like the dual todo detail vs todo edit modals, should be single unified experience
