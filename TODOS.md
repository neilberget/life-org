- expand chat view
- TODOs need to have a dedicated view I can go into
- Todos should let me kick of an AI chat about that todo, which can edit it, research it, etc
- Archive journal entries -- or better verb, but they get excluded from future context
- Should be MCP Server
- Integrations. If i paste an asana link into a todo, should be smart
