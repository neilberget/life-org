- Archive journal entries -- or better verb, but they get excluded from future context
- Integrations. If i paste an asana link into a todo, should be smart
- make sure process_link_previews cached results
- expand chat view
- daily planner mode -- pulls it all together
- I don't like the dual todo detail vs todo edit modals, should be single unified experience
